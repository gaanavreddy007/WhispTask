# Voice Announcements Disabled - Test Guide

## What was disabled:
1. **TtsService.speak()** method - Now only logs messages instead of speaking
2. **VoiceService._provideVoiceFeedback()** method - Disabled voice feedback
3. **VoiceService._provideFeedback()** method - Disabled audio feedback
4. **TaskProvider._speakFeedback()** method - Disabled TTS feedback

## What still works:
- ✅ Voice recognition (speech-to-text)
- ✅ Voice commands processing
- ✅ Wake word detection ("Hey Whisp")
- ✅ Task creation via voice
- ✅ Task completion via voice
- ✅ All other voice command functionality

## What's disabled:
- ❌ Voice announcements when tasks are created
- ❌ Voice confirmations when tasks are completed
- ❌ Voice feedback for errors
- ❌ Voice guidance messages
- ❌ All TTS (text-to-speech) output

## How to test:
1. Open the app
2. Say "Hey Whisp, create task buy groceries"
3. The task should be created but NO voice announcement should play
4. Say "Hey Whisp, mark buy groceries as done"
5. The task should be completed but NO voice confirmation should play

## Technical details:
- All TTS methods now return early and only log debug messages
- Voice recognition pipeline remains fully functional
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Easy to re-enable by uncommenting the disabled code sections
